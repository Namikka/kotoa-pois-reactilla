# Kotoa pois, reactilla

Tells you what kind of weather outside is and what you should maybe wear.

## What is this all about?

Instead of calculating the amount and type of clothing I need outside my house, I make the computer do it because I am human.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
